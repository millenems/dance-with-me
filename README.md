##### Under here it's being shown the first screen (where your press start) and already the game play.

## HOW TO PLAY?
You have to be agile! First of all you have to memorize the commands that it's shown on the first screen it's with then that you are going to play, then you have to pay attention on witch color will blink, then in the same time you will have to press the letter that corresponds on that color. If you get to late or press the wrong one you lose points. The only way for you to completely lose (game over) is if your score is at -30 orders cases, you are a winner, maybe not a good player, but a winner.

#### HOPE YOU ENJOY, AND HAVE FUN!!!
